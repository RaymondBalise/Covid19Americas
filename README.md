# Covid19Americas
COVID-19 in the Americas 

This is the code that creates: http://www.obscontencovid.info/.

The entire site was built in R using:
+ shiny
    + shinythemes
    + shinydashboard
+ tidyverse
    + conflicted
    + ggthemes
+ plotly
+ leaflet
+ sp
+ DT

Given the urgency of the need to control covid-19, this site was built as fast as possible, to allow people working with high-resolution monitors to understand the data. There are display issues on smaller monitor that can be solved by reworking the Shiny code to play better with bootstrap.  If you are interested in collaborating to make the site work better in any way please let us know.
